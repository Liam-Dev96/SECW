# Admin Page Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `Admin.xaml.cs` page, its functionality, and key components.

## Overview

The `Admin.xaml.cs` file is the code-behind for the Admin Page in the application. It handles the logic and interactions for the Admin interface, including user management, settings, and other administrative tasks.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Add, edit, and delete users.
- **Settings Management**: Update application settings.
- **Data Handling**: Load and save data to the database or other storage.

## Code Structure

### Namespaces
The file includes the following namespaces:
- `System`
- `System.Windows`
- `System.Windows.Controls`
- `System.Linq`
- `System.Collections.Generic`

### Main Components
1. **Constructor**  
    Initializes the Admin Page and sets up event handlers.

    ```csharp
    public Admin()
    {
         InitializeComponent();
         // Additional initialization code
    }
    ```

2. **Event Handlers**  
    Handles user interactions such as button clicks.

    ```csharp
    private void AddUserButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
         // Code to add a new user
    }
    ```

3. **Helper Methods**  
    Contains utility functions for data validation, loading, and saving.

    ```csharp
    private void LoadUsers()
    {
         // Code to load user data
    }
    ```

## UI Interaction

The `Admin.xaml.cs` file interacts with the `Admin.xaml` file, which defines the UI layout. Key UI elements include:
- Buttons for user actions (e.g., Add, Edit, Delete).
- DataGrid for displaying user information.
- TextBoxes for input fields.

## Example Workflow

1. **Loading Users**  
    When the page loads, the `LoadUsers` method is called to populate the user list.

2. **Adding a User**  
    Clicking the "Add User" button triggers the `AddUserButton_Click` event, which validates input and updates the data source.

3. **Editing/Deleting Users**  
    Similar event handlers manage editing and deleting users.

## Notes

- Ensure proper error handling for all user actions.
- Follow security best practices when managing user data.
